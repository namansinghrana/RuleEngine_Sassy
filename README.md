This project is a 3-tier rule engine application designed to determine user eligibility based on attributes such as **age**, **department**, **income**, **spend**, etc. The system uses **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** to represent conditional rules, allowing dynamic creation, combination, and modification of these rules.

## Objective

The application evaluates complex rules dynamically based on a user's data attributes. The system provides APIs for:
- Creating rules and converting them into ASTs.
- Combining multiple rules efficiently.
- Evaluating rules against user data.

## Key Features
- **AST Representation**: Uses AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) to define and evaluate rules.
- **Rule Creation**: Dynamically create rules from strings and represent them in AST form.
- **Rule Combination**: Efficiently combine multiple rules while avoiding redundant checks.
- **Rule Evaluation**: Evaluate rules against a userâ€™s data to determine eligibility.

## Functionalities

### For Users:
- **Rule Creation**: Create conditional rules using a simple UI and convert them into Abstract Syntax Trees (AST).
- **Rule Modification**: Modify existing rules by changing operators, operand values, or adding/removing sub-expressions within the AST.
- **Rule Evaluation**: Evaluate rules against user attributes (like age, department, salary, experience) to determine eligibility.
- **Dynamic Rule Combination**: Combine multiple rules into a single AST while minimizing redundant checks using efficient strategies.
  
### For Administrators:
- **Rule Management**: Manage a catalog of user-defined rules, including creating, updating, and deleting rules.
- **View Rule Details**: View detailed representations of rules in AST format for validation and debugging purposes.
  
### General Features:
- **Simple UI**: User-friendly interface for creating and managing rules.
- **API Integration**: Well-defined API endpoints for creating, combining, and evaluating rules.
- **Data Persistence**: Store rules and metadata in a PostgreSQL database to ensure persistence and retrieval.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling for invalid rule strings or data formats to ensure robust application behavior.
- **Validation**: Validate attributes to ensure they conform to predefined criteria in the rule catalog.
